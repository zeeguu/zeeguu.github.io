# Applied NLP Challenges

All of the following challenges would make the system better and need to be solved in a multilingual manner: 

## Difficulty 
- Estimating article difficulty level - e.g. CEFR (in progress)
- *Personalizing* article difficulty - based on the detailed history
- Text simplification

## Better exercises
- Generating textual-knowledge questions 
- Detecting *particle verbs* (and similar particles) reliably so we can highlight them correctly when translating

## Content Recommendations
- Fine-grained interest discovery
- Video / audio recommendations
- Content-filtering - the student who wanted "not to see articles about people dyeing"
- Main-content extraction from web articles (the last 5%)

## Chat agents
- that adapt to the current learner level and interests

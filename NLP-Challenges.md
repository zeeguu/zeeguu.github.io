# Applied NLP Challenges

All of the following challenges would make the system better and need to be solved in a multi-lingual manner: 
- estimating article difficulty level - e.g. CEFR 
- *personalizing* article difficulty - based on the detailed history
- generating textual-knowledge questions
- detecting *particle verbs* (and similar particles) reliably so we can highlight them correctly when translating
- text simplification
- fine-grained interest discovery
- video / audio recommendations

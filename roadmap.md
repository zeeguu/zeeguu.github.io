# Roadmap

The following are, as of yet, categorized but *unprioritized* directions:

## Crawler
- Language-independent paywall detection using BERT embeddings
- Add support for finding social media and video content


## Extension
- Allow reading content that is not article like
	- forums (e.g. reddit)
	- uploading images (with the help of OCR)

## Web 
- Allow users to upload their own content (could be text, could be an image as in Dansk in Town)

## Development 
- Unify the extension and the web repositories
- Unify the code for the two readers

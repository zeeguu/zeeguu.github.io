# Roadmap

The following are, as of yet, categorized but *unprioritized* directions. 


## Features
- Add support for finding social media and video content
- Extension: allow reading content that is not article like
	- forums (e.g. reddit)
	- uploading images (with the help of OCR)
- Allowing users to upload their own content (could be text, could be an image as in Dansk in Town)

## Development 
- unify the extension and the web repositories
- unify the code for the two readers

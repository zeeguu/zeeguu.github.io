# Streaks for Motivation

- Mircea: One opportunity for encouragement is really when one comes back to the application. Today, when I came back I could have seen exactly the message that I realized when I looked at my Stats: `I’m actually doing a great job: I have two days in a row and with one more I’ll be on a three day streak!`. However,  going to the stats is one click too much. I would not normally do it.

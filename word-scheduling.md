Many decisions have to be taken when designing the exercises in Zeeguu. Taking notes of some of them here. 

Is it good or bad that you arrive some days and "there's no words for you"?

If you want to go for 50 words limit, then maybe you should be cramming.

Should we have a 50 words limit?

No. Just prioritize frequent words. But then these frequent words would push out others that one has already started working on. 

Should we consider learned as being only receptive? 


Variants

- spaced repetition + when there's a day w/o anything to study, introduce new wors.
- spaced repetition + prioritizing common words ... common words should push the others away
	- as soon as you translate a word - 
	- it might be choppy at the beginning a bit
	- but we can use it in alignment with the progress visualization: the words you're translating...

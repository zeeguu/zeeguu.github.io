# Generating New Exercises


Open questions
- What to do when the same word is translated multiple times in the same article? 
	- No duplicate words will be introduced in a day (is it day or session?)
	- However, it might be that multiple bookmarks of the same word will haunt the learner in multiple days 
- Do people learn to associate translations to a given context, w/o actually learning the meaning of the word?
  - If this were trye, we could try to avoid this by finding different contexts in the past readings of the learner; maybe in the same text; maybe in different texts?
  - Alternatively is to hope that this does not happen very often?
